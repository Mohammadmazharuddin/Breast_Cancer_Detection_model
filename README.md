# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Detection Model

This project uses machine learning to detect breast cancer based on diagnostic data. It leverages classification algorithms to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy and performance metrics (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, etc.)
- Visualization of results

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset is based on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset**.
- It includes 30 numeric features derived from images of breast mass cell nuclei.

## 📊 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
